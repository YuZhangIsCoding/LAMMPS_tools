# LAMMPS_tools

This repo contains some useful tools to build MD simulations in LAMMPS. The initial thought for this repo is to convert some GROMACS files into LAMMPS file format, because most of my previous simulations are done in GROMACS. Also, I found it easier to build initial configuration files in GROMACS, which provides plenty of built-in tools to help manipulate molecules' coordinates.
Some of scripts in this repo could also be used for general purposes, such as combining LAMMPS data files, postprocessing, etc.

**Please check the example repo for usage.**
